      <h1>Welcome to Gondola Space: A Space for Gondolas!</h1>
      <p>
         The site has just begun construction (2020-08-14). I've been experimenting with an animated favicon (by making it cycle through about 50 .ico files, instead of using a .gif), but it has caused this page to become very resource intensive for some reason. I'm testing out using a .gif instead now, to see whether it works in Chrome. I'll replace it with a static image if this doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
         I'm going to play around with it a bit more and figure out what's going on. In the mean time, check out this <a href="links.html">other page</a> that doesn't have an animated favicon for some gondola related links.
